Article(article1):

 title: FC Bayern Champions-League
 summary: Der FC Bayern feiert nach dem Sieg gegen Dortmund in London den Gewinn der Champions League Ribéry bunkert den Henkelpokal an seinem Tisch
 entry: It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

 title: Ready to be Berliners too! Obama visits Berlin
 summary: Ready to be Berliners too! Michelle and the girls ditch casual clothes as Obamas land in Germany for President's landmark speech.  Comes almost exactly 50 years since JFK gave 'Ich bin ein Berliner' speech
 entry: Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

 title: Start me up - India’s economy is stabilizing
 summary: Despite a tumbling currency, India’s economy has got more stable in the past year. But a revival in growth remains elusive
 entry: INDIA’S richest man may also be its most optimistic. On June 6th Mukesh Ambani, the boss of Reliance Industries, addressed an auditorium in Mumbai watched by his glamorous wife in the front row and bodyguards with oiled submachine guns in the wings. India’s economy, he said, was in a funk but his faith was “unshakable”. Soon the country would “trigger a major transformation of the world order”. The audience rose in delight.

 title: An American Tech Company Is Advertising Its American-Built Smartphone On The Most American Holiday
 summary: Happy Independence Day, fellow Americans! It’s time to go to the lake, eat some red meat, and, of course, buy a cell phone from a good ol’ American company, Motorola and Google. 
 entry: Dell never completely left Texas. Lenovo recently set up shop in North Carolina. Apple is reopening US-based factories formerly shuttered when overseas manufacturing was in vogue. But please, I beg you, consumer electronic companies, do not make a mundane product, slap a Made In America sticker on the back and pawn it off on unsuspecting Americans. Americans and American companies can build world-class products so please do nothing less.
