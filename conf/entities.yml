 title: FC Bayern Champions-League
 summary: Der FC Bayern feiert nach dem Sieg gegen Dortmund in London den Gewinn der Champions League Ribéry bunkert den Henkelpokal an seinem Tisch
 entry: It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

 title: Ready to be Berliners too! Obama visits Berlin
 summary: Ready to be Berliners too! Michelle and the girls ditch casual clothes as Obamas land in Germany for President's landmark speech.  Comes almost exactly 50 years since JFK gave 'Ich bin ein Berliner' speech
 entry: Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

 title: Start me up - India’s economy is stabilizing
 summary: Despite a tumbling currency, India’s economy has got more stable in the past year. But a revival in growth remains elusive
 entry: INDIA’S richest man may also be its most optimistic. On June 6th Mukesh Ambani, the boss of Reliance Industries, addressed an auditorium in Mumbai watched by his glamorous wife in the front row and bodyguards with oiled submachine guns in the wings. India’s economy, he said, was in a funk but his faith was “unshakable”. Soon the country would “trigger a major transformation of the world order”. The audience rose in delight.

 title: An American Tech Company Is Advertising Its American-Built Smartphone On The Most American Holiday
 summary: Happy Independence Day, fellow Americans! It’s time to go to the lake, eat some red meat, and, of course, buy a cell phone from a good ol’ American company, Motorola and Google. 
 entry: Dell never completely left Texas. Lenovo recently set up shop in North Carolina. Apple is reopening US-based factories formerly shuttered when overseas manufacturing was in vogue. But please, I beg you, consumer electronic companies, do not make a mundane product, slap a Made In America sticker on the back and pawn it off on unsuspecting Americans. Americans and American companies can build world-class products so please do nothing less.

 title: Hero Rides Again, With Big Boots to Fill. In ‘The Lone Ranger,’ Tonto Takes Center Stage
 summary: Directed by Gore Verbinski; written by Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio; director of photography, Bojan Bazelli; edited by Craig Wood and James Haygood; music by Hans Zimmer
 entry: Who was that masked man?” That is not a question likely to resonate much with young people today, unless they are asking it in earnest puzzlement. By young, I mean under 70. The Lone Ranger belongs to the ancient pop culture of the Great Depression and the early baby boom. His adventures were heard on radio, starting in the 1930s, and seen on television from 1949 to 1957, but unlike some of his cape-wearing peers, he has mostly stayed in the past, an object of fuzzy nostalgia and mocking incredulity, a symbol of simple pleasures and retrograde attitudes.

 title: ‘White House Down’ and Black Presidents on Screen
 summary: At one point in the action thriller “White House Down,” which opens June 28, the president of the United States, played by Jamie Foxx, is trying to thwart a paramilitary group that has overtaken the White House. 
 entry: It’s not a line many Hollywood versions of the leader of the free world would utter he it’s usually a he is often stuffier, a little bland maybe, and most often white. “White House Down,” directed by Roland Emmerich, doesn’t wear the race of its president on its sleeve, but it doesn’t shy away from the fact either. Before President Obama’s election, Dennis Haysbert set the standard for television presidents with his portrayal of David Palmer on “24.” But memorable black commanders in chief have been harder to come by on the big screen. And as with their real-life counterparts, they get their way only some of the time.

 title: Andy Murray must crush Wimbledon history as well as Novak Djokovic
 summary: Long-running rivalry of Murray and Djokovic guarantees these combatants will deliver a men's singles final of brutal intensity 
 entry: Whether or not Andy Murray can break through the next level of shackles the nation has wrapped around his psyche – the 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men's champion – his final against Novak Djokovic on Sunday will almost certainly be an ordeal. We will love it. The winner will too. For the loser, the pain will be considerable, to heart and body. The odds are overwhelmingly that this final will be similar to each of their past three battles for a grand slam title. In all four of their big clashes – the first was a relative blitz in three sets in Melbourne two years ago – they have spent nearly a thousand minutes across the net from each other, but the others, again for the Australian title in 2012 and this year, as well as the US Open last September, were the most brutal examinations of their commitment to the demands of the modern game.

 title: Stones refuse to fade away, with historic return to Hyde Park
 summary: 65,000 turn out in scorching central London as rock'n'roll veterans play landmark concert
 entry: The set began naturally enough with Start Me Up and then, 44 years after they first invited 200,000 fans to listen to them for free in Hyde Park, the Rolling Stones were off. And it sounded like – as if they really had never stopped. Next song up and Sir Micks voice was calling out the hallowed lyric Its only Rock n Roll (but I like it). And they did even the most sunburned and dehydrated in the crowd of 65000 found the strength to cheer and scream.

 title: In Cargo Delivery, the Three-Wheelers That Could
 summary: B-Line Sustainable Delivery moves freight around downtown Portland, Ore., on electric-assisted tricycles.
 entry: IT’S well-known that Portland really likes its bicycles. But its embrace of bike culture goes beyond its catering to commuters leisure riders and athletes. So bike-centric is Portland that its residents can have any of the following delivered to their doorsteps by cycle a pizza, a keg of pilsner, plumbing services or a hot tub. And the list grows from there. It’s logical, then, that a Portland entrepreneur, Franklin Jones, would have helped pioneer the new field of pedal-powered freight delivery. In 2009, Mr. Jones, a former teacher, founded B-Line Sustainable Urban Delivery, a company that delivers produce, baked goods, coffee beans, bike parts and office supplies to restaurants, bike shops and other businesses throughout Portland’s downtown area using electric-assisted tricycles that pull 60-cubic-foot cargo boxes with a 600-pound capacity.

 title: A Painful Mix of Fire, Wind and Questions
 summary: The Yarnell Hill fire burned on June 30, around the time when officials believe the fire expanded.
 entry: PRESCOTT Ariz. They trained their eyes on the mountain that smoldered in the distance as they carved a path through a forest choked by fire and drought. The ground crackled underfoot. Packs sagged from their backs heavy with the gear frontline firefighters must carry pickaxes temperature gauges, spades, radios, plenty of water. Down in the valley, a village burned. “This is pretty wild,” one of the firefighters, Andrew Ashcraft, wrote in a text message to his wife, Juliann, at 202 p.m. that Sunday as the team continued its fateful march through the wilderness.
